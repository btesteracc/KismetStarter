# KismetStarter
After reading and using the advice by  Roger CARHUATOCTO on https://holisticsecurity.io/2016/02/27/wardriving-wifi-pineapple-nano-mobile-world-congress-2016-barcelona/ about
how to use Kismet on a WiFi Pineapple Nano, I got interested in creating a module for that.
The workflow to operate kismet over ssh from a smartphone was not too fast and easy. Therefore I took this as my first project to
develop a module for the WiFi Pineapple and use the given scripts as the background services.
This is what came out of my testing.
